##Kyle's Portfolio

## Description
I created a website for a marketing company that prioritizes accessibility and user-friendliness. The design and layout adhere to industry standards to ensure that the site is easy to navigate for all users.

I developed a comprehensive study guide for students enrolled in a boot camp to help them with prework. The guide provides detailed and helpful information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, designed to aid students in their learning and preparation for the program.

I designed and created a Pseudo Element cheatsheet aimed at individuals interested in learning more about this topic. The cheatsheet presents the key concepts and techniques of Pseudo Elements in a clear and concise manner, making it a valuable resource for those looking to expand their knowledge on the subject.
